          CRITERIA:
          - Look for power-deficit language explicitly stated OR implied through framing

          QUESTION: Does the text indicate HOW the information was gathered (e.g., "In an interview with," "Based on a review of public records," "After analyzing court documents," "According to a survey of 500 respondents"), either explicitly or through clear implication?
          
          CRITERIA:
          - Should describe methodology explicitly OR imply rigorous information gathering
          - Look for phrases indicating interviews, document review, or data analysis
          - Clear indication of journalistic process counts

          You are a content analyst. Analyze the following article for ONE specific indicator.
          
          QUESTION: Does the headline or lead paragraph (first 1-2 paragraphs) contain subjective adjectives intended to elicit shock, outrage, or strong emotion (e.g., "Horrifying," "Shocking," "Bizarre," "Disgraceful," "Stunning," "Perfect," "Devastating")?
          
          CRITERIA:
          - Focus ONLY on headline and lead paragraph
          - Look for emotionally-charged adjectives, explicit OR implied through word choice
          - Consider whether the language is designed to provoke emotional reaction
          - Subtle emotional loading through framing also counts

          You are a content analyst. Analyze the following article for ONE specific indicator.
          
          QUESTION: Does the text use reductive labels for groups of people (e.g., "The Woke," "The MAGA crowd," "Libs," "Trumpers," "Snowflakes," "Boomers," "Elites") instead of their formal or neutral designations?
          
          CRITERIA:
          - Look for informal, reductive labels for groups, explicit OR implied through framing
          - Consider whether groups are characterized dismissively or reductively
          - Othering through framing counts, not just explicit labels

          You are a content analyst. Analyze the following article for ONE specific indicator.
          
          QUESTION: Does the text use definitive causal language (e.g., "caused," "proved," "is because," "directly led to," "is the result of") for complex social, economic, or political phenomena where causality is legitimately debated among experts?
          
          CRITERIA:
          - Look for definitive causal claims (explicit OR implied through framing) about complex issues
          - Simple factual causation (e.g., "the fire was caused by a spark") does NOT count
          - Framing that suggests certain causality for debated issues counts

          You are a content analyst. Analyze the following article for ONE specific indicator.
          
          QUESTION: Does the text use the second person ("You") or imperative verbs ("Wake up," "Look at this," "Consider this," "Don't be fooled," "Remember") to directly address the reader?
          
          CRITERIA:
          - Should directly address the reader explicitly OR through implied conversational tone
          - Imperative commands or "you" language in the article's voice
          - Framing that positions the reader as part of a conversation counts

          You are a content analyst. Analyze the following article for ONE specific indicator.
          
          QUESTION: Does the text use "scare quotes" around a term to imply irony, skepticism, or illegitimacy (e.g., The "expert" said..., The so-called "reform"..., Their "evidence"...) without explaining the basis for the skepticism?
          
          CRITERIA:
          - Look for skepticism conveyed through scare quotes OR other framing devices
          - The skepticism can be implied through punctuation or word choice
          - Framing that delegitimizes concepts without explanation counts
